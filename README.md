**Procrastination**

**Description**
A game for all those who have time to waste.
Procrastination is a role-playing game based on the classic pokemon Red & Blue. You have to help the main character fulfill his household chores without wasting too much time.
As in real life, time goes fast and by the time you realize it, sometimes it's too late.
It brings the best of 90â€™s gaming nostalgia with all the pressure that only adulthood can offer us.
if the clock strikes midnight, you've lost and if you complete all the tasks in time, you've won the game.

**MVP**
The game has three classes: the **player**, which the user the control, and that can wander on the game field with the only limits being the sides of the subway car and the presence of the controller, which moves towards the player.
Then there are **NPCs** next to all exits of the train car.
Last, there is the **controller** (surprise!) popping up on the screen and acting as a countdown for the user to do the right move.
**Backlog**
Implement other characters to interact with the main character.
Implement more interactive and interesting texts.
Implement a function for the clock to run faster if a procrastination event is activated.
