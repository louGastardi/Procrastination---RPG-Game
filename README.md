<h1>Procrastination</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>
A game for all those who have time to waste.
Procrastination is a role-playing game based on the classic pokemon Red & Blue. You have to help the main character fulfill his household chores without wasting too much time.
As in real life, time goes fast and by the time you realize it, sometimes it's too late.
It brings the best of 90â€™s gaming nostalgia with all the pressure that only adulthood can offer us.
if the clock strikes midnight, you've lost and if you complete all the tasks in time, you've won the game.

<h2>MVP</h2>
The game starts with a screen and you have to click on it for the game to actually start. On the <span>game screen</span>, you can see a list of the tasks to be completed and a fast-forwarding clock.
The <span>player</span> moves using the arrows across the map to complete these tasks.
You have to check all chores before the clock strikes midnight to win the game.
When the game ends (either by the clock or by completing the mission) a screen appears telling the player to stop wasting time playing games and to carry out some tasks in real life.

<h2>Backlog</h2>
Implement other characters to interact with the <span>player</span>.
Implement more interactive and interesting texts.
Implement a function for the clock to run faster if a procrastination event is activated.
Sound Effects and music.
